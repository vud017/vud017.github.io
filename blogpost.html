            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>We recently launched the latest project from the Git Rekt team. It is a 2D platform game called "Moustache Mania" based on the LibGDX framework. Although the framework was unfamiliar at first, it proved to be well-suited for game development. The project was coded in Java, and we had a very positive experience working as a team.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Great Collaboration</h2>
            <p>The collaboration within the team has been outstanding. There has been a light and good atmosphere among us, and communication has been seamless. We have often sat together, not only to work on the project but also to support each other. This has made it easy for everyone to ask questions and get help, even if the rest of the team might be working on something else.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Effective Communication</h2>
            <p>Regular meetings and updates have ensured that everyone has been kept up to date. We have used Discord for daily and remote communication, which has worked particularly well when some team members were away. Discord has also been an excellent solution for sending files and merge requests. Despite this digital communication, we have also had a strong physical presence.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Agile Methodology</h2>
            <p>We have followed a methodology that is a mix of Scrum and Kanban, "Scrumban", with dedicated goals and weekly meetings, working mostly in "sprints". In addition, we have had more frequent, informal conversations when we have been together physically. This combination of structure and flexibility has kept us focused and productive.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Using Kanban</h2>
            <p>The Kanban board has been a clear and useful tool for keeping track of tasks. It has given us insight into what everyone is working on and what is planned for the future. This has improved our efficiency and ability to support each other.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Git Workflow</h2>
            <p>Throughout the project, we have become comfortable with the Git workflow using GitLab. This has provided us with a structured and efficient way to work as a team. The ability to track changes, handle merge requests, and collaborate on code has strengthened our ability to work together.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Overall, this project has been a testament to the value of good collaboration and effective communication. By using tools like Discord, Kanban boards, and GitLab, and by creating a positive and cooperative environment, we have created a great game with the LibGDX framework. This experience has not only improved our technical skills but also strengthened our ability to work as a cohesive unit.</p>
